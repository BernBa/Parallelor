# Parallelor
This Python-based program helps to match the results of DNA-sequence alignment back onto a .csv-file of a gloss corpus.
The semi-automatic process outputs a list of parallel glosses.

## Requirements
A .csv-file for each manuscript (named by their abbreviation) with two columns: ID (= the gloss number) and Gloss (= the text of the gloss). 
The rest is automatically established while running the program.

## Imprint
The work on this program was funded by the MSCA-IF project "Early Medieval Glosses And The Question Of Their Genesis: A Case Study On The Vienna Bede" (Grant agreement ID: 101019035), hosted by Institute Centre for Information Modelling (University of Graz).
