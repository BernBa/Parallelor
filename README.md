# Parallelor
This Python-based program helps to match the results of DNA-sequence alignment back onto a .csv-file of a gloss corpus.
The semi-automatic process outputs a list of parallel glosses.

## Requirements
A .csv-file for each manuscript (named by their abbreviation) with two columns: ID (= the gloss number) and Gloss (= the text of the gloss). 
The rest is automatically established while running the program.
